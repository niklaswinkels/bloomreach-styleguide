## Logo

The logo is one of our most valuable assets. Treat it nicely.  When this logo doesn't sit well in certain settings, one of the logo variations should be used (see below). The horizontal version should be used most often.

When you're working on a dark background, use this reverse logo. Ideally the background color would be black, this allows the logo to be seen nice and clear.

Positioning

Clearspace guide
 Always leave the required amount of clear space around the logo. the minimum clear space is equal to "o".
Clear space gives the logo room to breathe and makes sure it's not hugging up to anything it's not supposed to.
